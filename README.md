# surfs_up
## Overview:
In this this project, I'll complete an analysis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii to determine whether a potential Surf n' Shake shop business can 
sustainably operate year-round. This will help to convince an investor who is hesitant opening the business because he invested in a similar business that
failed due to the weather conditions. In order to get this investor on board, Iâ€™ll need to provide statistical analytics on the weather conditions in Oahu
that will convince him that this will be a successful business idea.T o analyze Hawaii's weather data, SQLAlchemy was used to query the SQLite database.
